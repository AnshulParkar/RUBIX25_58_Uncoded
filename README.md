SOCIAL CAUSE - Problem Statement: Food Rescue Platform

Food wastage is a major global issue, with millions of tons of edible food being discarded each year while millions of people face hungerand food insecurity. The goal is to create a platform that connectsfood donors (such as restaurants, households, and food suppliers) with recipients (such as shelters, food banks, and community centers) to rescue excess food, reduce waste, and provide nutritious meals to those in need. This platform will foster collaboration within local communities to combat food insecurity in an efficient and sustainable way.
